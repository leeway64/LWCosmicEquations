This project contains 2 programs, one for calculating a civilization's Kardashev rating
(`kardashev-scale`), and one that calculates the Drake Equation from some user-entered values
(`drake-equation`).

Refer to [this](doc/README.md) document for more information on the Kardashev Scale and the Drake
Equation.
