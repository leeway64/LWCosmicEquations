# Additional Information on the Kardashev Scale, the Drake Equation, and the Fermi Paradox

## The Kardashev Scale

The Kardashev Scale is a
"[method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement based on the amount of energy it is able to use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale)";
check out the [Wikipedia page for the Kardashev Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale)
for a very interesting read.

Also, check out [the Kurzgesagt video on the Kardashev Scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhFK5_Nx9xY).
As usual, [Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/@kurzgesagt) puts out fantastic content.


## The Drake Equation and the Fermi Paradox

The Drake Equation is an equation used to estimate the number of
"[extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation)";
it is associated with the [Fermi Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox), the discrepancy
between the seemingly high likelihood of extraterrestrial life and a lack of evidence for such life.
The [fundamental problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox#Drake_equation) with the
equation, though, is that the last four terms of the equation are unknown.

For one of the most interesting Wikipedia articles out there, check out the
[section on potential explanations to the Fermi Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox#Hypothetical_explanations_for_the_paradox).

For more information on the Fermi Paradox, check out [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNhhvQGsMEc) and [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI) of Kurzgesagt's series on the Fermi Paradox.

For another solution to the Fermi Paradox, as explained by Kurzgesagt, check out Kurzgesagt's video
on [The Dark Forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUJYP8tnRE).

Any article about the Fermi Paradox would not be complete without a mention of the Great Filter,
which Kurzgesagt has made [an excellent video of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjtOGPJ0URM).
